Credit Coin: A Privacy-Preserving Blockchain-Based Incentive Announcement Network for Communications of Smart Vehicles

Abstract:
The vehicular announcement network is one of the most promising utilities in the communications of smart vehicles and in the smart transportation systems. In general, there are two major issues in building an effective vehicular announcement network. First, it is difficult to forward reliable announcements without revealing users' identities. Second, users usually lack the motivation to forward announcements. In this paper, we endeavour to resolve these two issues through proposing an effective announcement network called Credit Coin, a novel privacy-preserving incentive announcement network based on Blockchain via an efficient anonymous vehicular announcement aggregation protocol. On the one hand, Credit Coin allows nondeterministic different signers (i.e., users) to generate the signatures and to send announcements anonymously in the nonfully trusted environment. On the other hand, with Blockchain, Credit Coin motivates users with incentives to share traffic information. In addition, transactions and account information in Credit Coin are tamper-resistant. Credit Coin also achieves conditional privacy since Trace manager in CreditCoin traces malicious users' identities in anonymous announcements with related transactions. CreditCoin thus is able to motivate users to forward announcements anonymously and reliably. Extensive experimental results show that CreditCoin is efficient and practical in simulations of smart transportation.
Existing system
Vehicular announcement can help to avoid traffic jams and allow peoples to know any accident or event occur at any route prior of choosing that route but this announcement contains some flaws as user privacy leakage who involved in announcement as their current location and vehicle ID will be exposed to other peoples and they can misuse this location information to kidnap peoples and other flaw is lack of motivation in user to involved themselves to announce that information to other vehicles which are in their range.

Disadvantages:
1.	Less Accuracy
2.	More time taking process
Proposed system
In proposed system, introducing concept called Blockchain & incentive based privacy preserving announcement in vehicular network. In propose paper is motivating users to announce their location and event or others received data by providing INCENTIVES and to earn incentive all peoples will get involved in announcement and  adding another concept to avoid incentive lock where user incentives will be expired at the end of the day so they may use this incentive to post their new data to new users.
Advantages:
1.	High Accuracy
2.	Takes less time
